I am working on creating a drawing with lots of different shapes and then paint it in different colors.

Go to this link to view the final image of the drawing: https://github.com/Ventengo1/Shape-painting/commit/45fdd5ed74c7c839d01539165f1687971a2c99ec

Next I will paint it in. I will leave a imag here once I submit that for scrapbook and am finished.
